This is my first animated wallpaper for android.

It features a skull wearing a tiara and crossed chainsaws beneath.
The teeth on the chainsaws are animated.

All the java code is mine, and I made the SVG, but the artistic
concept belongs to someone else.  Fans will recognize it instantly.

Perhaps the major technical contribution of this project is the
svgToAndroid/ module which contains an application which translates an
SVG into java code that renders into a Canvas object (usually using
the Path class).  

You can see the source art for the wallpaper's static elements in
svgs/skull.svg.

Some important articles I used were

So if anyone ever asks you what Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry
are good for, you can whip out this live wallpaper.
